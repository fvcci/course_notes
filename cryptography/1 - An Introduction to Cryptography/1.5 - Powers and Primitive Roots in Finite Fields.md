# Powers and Primitive Roots in Finite Fields
## Theorem: Fermat's Little Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number and let $a$ be any integer. Then,
$$
	a^{p-1} \equiv \begin{cases*}
		1 \pmod{p} \ \ if \ p \nmid a, \\
		0 \pmod p \ \ if \ p \mid a
	\end{cases*}
$$

### Remark
Let $p$ be prime. Then,
$$a^{-1} \equiv a^{p-2} \pmod p$$
Since multiplying $a^{p-2}$  by $a$ equals $1 \text{ mod } p$ by ***Fermat's Little Theorem***.

## Definition: Order of $a \text{ mod } p$ 
The ***order*** of $a \text{ mod } p$ is the smallest exponent $k \ge 1$ such that 
$$a^k \equiv 1 \pmod p$$
- This may look similar to ***Fermat's Little Theorem***, but this is just saying that there may be smaller powers of $a$ that are congruent to $1$.
