# Bilinear Parings on Elliptic Curves
## Points of Finite Order on Elliptic Curves
### Definition
![[Pasted image 20220612234932.png]]
- If $P$ and $Q$ are in $E[m]$, then $P+Q$ and $-P$ are in $E[m]$
	- Thus $E[m]$ is a subgroup of $E$.

### Notation
$$E(K)[m]$$
For when we want the coordinates of $P$ to lie in a particular field $K$.
