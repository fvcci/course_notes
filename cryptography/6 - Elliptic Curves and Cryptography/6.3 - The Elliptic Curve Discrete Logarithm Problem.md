### Remark
#### First Difficulty
- May be points $P,Q \in E(\mathbb F_p)$ such that $Q$ is not a multiple of $P$.
- For cryptography, one starts with $P$ and $n$ to compute $Q = nP$.

#### Second Difficulty
- If $Q = nP$ is satisfied, then there are many such $n$'s that will also satisfy.

##### Proof
- $\exists s \in \mathbb Z^+$ s.t. $sP = \mathcal O$.
- Since $E(\mathbb F_p)$ is finite, $P, 2P, 3P, \dots$ cannot all be distinct.
- $\exists k, j \in \mathbb Z$ with $k > j$ s.t. $kP = jP$, and we can take $s = k-j$.
- The smallest $s \ge 1$ is called the ***order of*** $P$ (which can divide $|E(\mathbb F_p)|$.
- Thus if $s$ is the order of $P$ and $n_0 \in \mathbb Z$  s.t. $Q = n_0 P$, then solutions to $Q = nP$ are integers $n = n_0 + is$ with $i \in \mathbb Z$.

Thus $\log_P(Q) \in \mathbb Z/s \mathbb Z$.

- ***point operation*** - the addition of two points in $E(\mathbb F_p)$.
