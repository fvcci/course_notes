### Definition: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Problem

- The $x$ coordinate of $n_1n_2P$ is kept as the secret shared value.
	- Having 1 $x$ coordinate allows for the $y$ coordinate to easily be computed, since there are only 2 options.
	- $x$ coordinate is the same regardless of which $y$ is used.

## Elliptic Elgamal Public Key Cryptosystem
$$Q_A = n_A P$$
- $Q_A$ - public key
- $n_A$ - private key
- $P$ - a point with $P \in E(\mathbb F_p)$.

- $M \in E(\mathbb F_p)$ is the plaintext.

### Difficulties
1. No obvious way to attach plaintext messages to points in $E(\mathbb F_p)$.
2. The elliptic Elgamal cryptosystem has 4-to-1 message expansion, as compared to the 2-to-1 expansion ratio of Elgamal using $\mathbb F_p$.
