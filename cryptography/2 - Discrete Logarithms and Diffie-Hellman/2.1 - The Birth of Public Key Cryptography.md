- ***one-way function*** - An invertible function that is easy to compute, but whose inverse is difficult to compute.
- ***trapdoor*** - A piece of auxiliary information that allows the inverse to be easily computed.
- For each pair $(k_{pub}, k_{priv})$, there is an encryption algorithm $e_{k_{pub}}$ and a decryption algorithm $d_{k_{priv}}$.
	- The private key $k_{priv}$ is ***trapdoor information*** for $e_{k_{pub}}$.
