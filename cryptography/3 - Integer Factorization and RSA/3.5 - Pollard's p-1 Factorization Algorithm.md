# Pollard's $p-1$ Factorization Algorithm
## Goal
- Presented with $N = pq$
- Determine its prime factors $p$ and $q$.

## Method
- Find an integer $L$ such that
	- $p-1 \mid L$
	- $q-1 \nmid L$
	then,

Computing $a^L$, we have that

It is unlikely for $a^K$ to be divisible by $q$.

- Thus
	- $p \mid a^L - 1$
	- $q \nmid a^L - 1$
- So
	- $p = \text{gcd}(a^L - 1, N)$]

So how do you find $L$?
If $p-1$ happens to be a product of small primes, then $p-1 \mid n!$ for some small value $n$. Thus, for each $n = 2, 3, 4, \dots$, choose a value $a$ and compute
$$\begin{align*}
	n := \text{gcd}(a^{n!} - 1, N) \\
\end{align*}$$
- If $n \le 1$, then increment $n$ and loop again
- If $1 < n < N$, then we found the factor $p$.

- $l \le B$ since $n \mid B!$ with all factors of $B!$ being $\le B$ means factors of $n$ must be $\le B$.
