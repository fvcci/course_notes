# Accelerating Poly1305 Cryptographic Message Authentication on the z14
## Background
- ***AEAD*** - Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data
	- Support two operations: "seal" and "open"
	- *seal* - encrypts and then signs with a ***MAC***
	- *open* - decrypts and verifies that the ***MAC*** is valid
- ***MAC*** - Message Authentication Code

- ***Poly1305 / ChaCha20*** - an encryption cipher system in the class ***AEAD***
	- *ChaCha20* - stream cipher for encryption part of ***AEAD***
	- *Poly1305* - signing algorithm to generate the ***MAC***

- ***Univariate Polynomial*** - a polynomial in a single variable as opposed to a multivariate polynomial.

- ***Little-Endian*** - Least significant value is stored first
- ***Big-Endian*** - Greatest significant value is stored first

- ***Prime Field*** - A [[1.4 Prime Numbers, Unique Factorization, and Finite Fields|finite field]] comprised of whole non-negative integers less than a prime number.

## Poly1305
It creates an [[#Background|MAC]] by computing a [[#Background|univariate polynomial]] over a [[#Background|prime field]]:

where $m[0] \dots m[l-1]$ are modified 16 byte message blocks.
- Block $m[l-1]$ could be shorter but conventionally is a whole number of bytes.
- if $n$ is the length in bits, then $2n$ is added to message blocks to prevent cryptographic attacks on possible leading zeros.
- $r$ - the first 16 bytes of a 32-byte key.
- $s$ - the second 16 bytes of a 32-byte key.
- Quantities are in [[#Background|little endian]] order.

## Limbs and Prime Fields
- $2^{130}-5$ - a prime number used in Poly1305

We can rewrite the [[#Poly1305|Poly1305 equation]] as
![[Pasted image 20220628144011.png]]
which can be staged as iterations with
1.  An addition
2. A multiplication by $t$
3. A mod by $2^{130} - 5$ (called *reduction*, designated $\varrho[\dots]$)

### Issues
1. The numbers are large - $m[n]$ and $r$ can be considered 130 bit numbers
2. *Reduction* with division and remainder is too expensive

### Solution
Express the large binary numbers as digits, called *limbs*. A common choice for the size of *limbs* in Poly1305 is 26 bits
- 5 limbs are needed to cover 130 bit numbers.

Reduction consists of taking overflow bits from each lib and adding them to the next higher-value limb. For overflow bits in the highest-value limb, they are added to the lowest value limb with a simple trick:

## Comba Multiplication with Modulus
Consider an example in radix 10 with prime 997 (such that $1000 - 997 = 3$). Let's multiply $576 \cdot 895$. Note that 
$$576 \cdot 895 \text{ mod } 997 = 71$$
Using school book multiplication,

**Note:** the number of individual multiplications is the square of the number of digits, or the number of *limbs*.
