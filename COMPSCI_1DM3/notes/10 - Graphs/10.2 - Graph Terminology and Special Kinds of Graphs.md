# Graph Terminology and Special Kinds of Graphs
- ***adjacent/neighbours*** - two vertices $u$, $v$ are adjacent in an undirected graph if an edge is between $u$ and $v$. The edge is called ***incident*** with $u$ and $v$.
- ***neighbourhood*** - set of all neighbours in a vertex $v$ of $G = (V, E)$ (denoted $N(v)$). If $A$ is a subset of $V$, $N(A)$ is the set of all vertices in $G$ adjacent to at least one vertex in $A$. Thus
  $$N(A) = \bigcup_{v \in A} N(v)$$
- ***degree of a vertex*** - in an undirected graph, it is the number of edges incident with the vertex, with a loop contributing 2 times. Denoted $\text{deg}(v)$.
