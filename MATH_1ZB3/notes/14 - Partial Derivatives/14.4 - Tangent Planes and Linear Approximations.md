The ***tangent plane*** to the surface $S$ at point $P$ is the plane that contains both tangent lines $T_1$ and $T_2$. The tangent plane consists of all possible tangent lines at $P$.

- Basically a linear combination

## Linear Approximations
*Idea*: The tangent line approximates a function near a point.
Equation of plane passing through $(x, y, z) = (a, b, c) = (a, b, f(a, b))$:
$$z - c = C_1(x - a) + C_2(y - b)$$
- So solve for the tangent lines, we fix $x = a$ to find the equation along $y$ and fix $y = b$ to find the tangent for $x$.
- $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the slopes for the $x$ and $y$ tangents.
