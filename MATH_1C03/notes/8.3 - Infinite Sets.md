# Infinite Sets
We say $X$ is ***infinite*** *iff* it is not ***finite***

## Theorem
$\mathbb N$ is infinite.

### Proof
Suppose $\mathbb N$ is finite (for a contradiction). Then there is $k \in \mathbb N$ with $\mathbb N \approx \mathbb N_k$. Let $f : \mathbb N \mapsto \mathbb N_k$ be a bijection. Let $m > k$. Observe that $\mathbb N_m \subseteq \mathbb N$, so we can define the restriction:
$$g = f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_m} : \mathbb N_m \mapsto \mathbb N_k$$
#### Problem:
$g$ is an injection!
 If $i \ne j, i, j \in \mathbb N_m$, then
 $$g(i) = f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_m}(i) = f(i) \ne f(j) = f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_m}(j) = g(j)$$
 But then we have an injection from $\mathbb N_m \to \mathbb N_k$, which contradicts pigeonhole!

## Theorem
If $A \subseteq B$ and $A$ is infinite, then $B$ is infinite.

### Proof
Assume $A$ is infinite. Suppose for a  contradiction that $B$ is finite. Then there is some $k$ such that there exists an injection
$$f : B \to \mathbb N_k$$
Then $g = f \upharpoonright_A : A \to \mathbb N_k$ is an injection
But then $A$ must be finite, a contradiction.

## Corollary
$\mathbb Z, \mathbb Q, \mathbb R, \mathbb C, \dots$ are all infinite.

## Definition
Let $X$ be a set. We say 
1. $X$ is ***denumerable/enumerable*** *iff* $X \approx \mathbb N$ (can index each element of $X$)
2. $X$ is ***countable*** *iff* $X$ is enumerable or finite.
3. $X$ is ***uncountable*** *iff* $X$ is not countable.

## Theorem
Suppose there is a surjection $f : \mathbb N \to A$. Then $A$ is countable.

*Idea*: $f$ may fail to be injective (there could be repeated values) but we may "delete" the repeats and construct a bijection.

## Theorem
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are denumerable. Then $A \cup B$ is denumerable.

### Proof
Suppose $f : \mathbb N \to A$ and $S : \mathbb N \mapsto B$ are bijections.
We want to "weave" or "dovetail". 

$$\begin{gather*}
	1 \mapsto f(1) \\
	2 \mapsto g(1) \\
	3 \mapsto f(2) \\
	4 \mapsto g(2) \\
	5 \mapsto f(3) \\
	6 \mapsto g(3) \\
	\vdots
\end{gather*}$$

Define a function $h : \mathbb N \to A \cup B$ by
$$
	h (n) = \begin{cases}
		f(\tfrac{n+1}{2}) \text{, if $n$ is odd} \\
		g(\tfrac{n}{2}) \text{, if $n$ is even} \\
	\end{cases}
$$
By the last theorem, we only need to check that this is surjective.

Let $y \in A \cup B$.

#### Case $y \in A$
- There is some $k \in \mathbb N$ such that $f(k) = y$.
- Consider $n = 2k - 1$.
- Then $h(n) = h(2k-1) = f(\tfrac{(2k-1)+1}{2}) = f(\tfrac{2k}{2}) = f(k) = y$.

#### Case $y \in B$
- There is some $k \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $g(k) = y$.
- Let $n = 2k$.
- Then $h(n) = h(2k) = g(\tfrac{2k}{2}) = g(k) = y$.

$\therefore$ $h : \mathbb N \to A \cup B$ is onto and so $A \cup B$ is *denumerable*.

## Theorem
$Q$ is denumerable.

### Proof
- Want to number all rationals (possibly with repeats).
- Construct a surjection from $\mathbb N \to \mathbb Q$.
- Let enumerate $\mathbb Q^+$ (then use that $\mathbb Q = \mathbb Q^+ \cup Q^- \cup \{ 0 \})$
- Let's arrange $\mathbb Q^+$ in a *grid*.

![[Pasted image 20220405121320.png]]

In this way we enumerate all of $\mathbb Q^+$
- So $\mathbb Q^+$ is enumerable.
- $\mathbb Q^-$ is enumerable because $f(x) = -x$ is a bijection from $\mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^-$
- So $\mathbb Q^+ \cup \mathbb Q^- \cup \{ 0 \}$ is denumerable also.

### Formal Proof
- Show $\mathbb N \times \mathbb N$ is denumerable
- Show $(n, m) \mapsto (\tfrac n m) \in \mathbb Q^+$ is a surjection.
